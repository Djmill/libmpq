.SH NAME
libmpq \- cross-platform C library for manipulating mpq archives.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B
#include <libmpq/mpq.h>
.sp
.BI "int libmpq__block_explode("
.BI "        unsigned char *" "in_buf",
.BI "        unsigned int   " "in_size",
.BI "        unsigned char *" "out_buf",
.BI "        unsigned int   " "out_size"
.BI ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Call \fBlibmpq__block_explode\fP() to explode a given block. If the block is encrypted it should be first decrypted using \fPlibmpq__block_decrypt\fP().
.LP
The \fBlibmpq__block_explode\fP() function takes as first argument the \fIin_buf\fP which is the input data buffer. The second argument \fIin_size\fP is the size of \fIin_buf\fP. The third argument \fIout_buf\fP is the output data buffer which contains the exploded data and the fourth argument \fIout_size\fP is the size of \fIout_buf\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the transferred bytes are returned and on error one of the following constants.
.TP
.B LIBMPQ_ERROR_NOT_INITIALIZED
libmpq wasn't initialized by calling \fBlibmpq__initialize\fP(), or it was shut down by an \fBlibmpq__shutdown\fP() call.
.TP
.B LIBMPQ_ERROR_MALLOC
Not enough memory for creating required structures.
.TP
.B LIBMPQ_ERROR_DECOMPRESS
Exploding block failed.
