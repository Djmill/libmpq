    */

   #include <limits.h>
   #include <libmpq/mpq.h>

   int main(int argc, char **argv) {
           mpq_archive_s *mpq_archive;

           mpq_archive = malloc(sizeof(mpq_archive_s));
           memset(mpq_archive, 0, sizeof(mpq_archive_s));

           libmpq__archive_open(mpq_archive, argv[1]);
           libmpq__file_open(mpq_archive, 1);
           libmpq__archive_close(mpq_archive);
