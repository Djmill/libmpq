Introduction
============

libmpq is a library which can be easily used in own applications
and a set of tools for manipulating mpq archives. At this moment
mpq-tools is able to show you file informations and extracting
files by their corresponding number and name. The filenames will
be identified through a listfile database.

MPQ, or MoPaQ, is a proprietary archive format created by
Mike O'Brien, the man hailed as Blizzard's multiplayer engine
genius, back in 1996 as a general purpose archive for use with
Diablo, and named narcissistically for its creator
"Mike O'brien PaCK". The copyrights to it, however, are held by
Havas Interactive, Blizzard's parent company. The archive format
is used by many Blizzard titles like Diablo, Diablo 2, Starcraft,
Warcraft 2: BNE, a newer version in Warcraft 3 and World of
Warcraft (WOW).

Manual
======

Since version 0.4.0 the 'mpq-tools' package comes with a manpage
for every library function. If you use 'mpq-tools' first time it
is a good idea to read the `FAQ' file.
